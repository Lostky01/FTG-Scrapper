# Finally, Its Done

This website is merely just my experience with NodeJs, Express, and React
i got a long holiday and i got so goddamn bored so i made this coz im tired of html css php native that has a slow af loading time
Made using FreeToGames Public api for the data inside, this simple website took 3 goddamn days to complete, zzz

# Javascript web development is so goddamn good

I never realized how good it is to develop a website with javascript, such a pleasure, easy to understand if you know atleast the fundamental of website programming.
<br>
usually it took me about 5 centuries to load a bulk data with native php and html, and with javascript it only took me like 0.000001 milisecond

# What is this made of ?

Mainly made from react, as this is literally my 3rd day learning javascript web development, i went straight to react and NodeJS and express, its so goddamn hard to stylize the UI in react, im using bootstrap react and scss to style, still, i have no fucking idea how does scss syntax written like, the backend is made from express and axios, nothing much though, only scrap a public website api to fetch the data and visualize it to an actual website
