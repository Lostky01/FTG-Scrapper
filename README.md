# Finally, Its Done

This website is merely just my experience with NodeJs, Express, and React
i got a long holiday and i got so goddamn bored so i made this coz im tired of html css php native that has a slow af loading time
Made using FreeToGames Public api for the data inside, this simple website took 3 goddamn days to complete, zzz

# Javascript web development is so goddamn good

I never realized how good it is to develop a website wit javascript, such a pleasure, easy to understand if you know atleast the fundamental of website programming
usually took me 5 centuries to load a bulk data with native php and html, and with javascript it only took me like 0.000001 milisecond
